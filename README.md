# Jumper Dude - Haskell Project

This repository contains a Haskell-based game developed as a university project, on the 1st semester of my 1st year. The game includes a series of levels, each requiring logical thinking and strategic movement to solve.

## Modules

- `LI12122`: Core game types and functions.
- `Tarefa1_2021li1g006`: Validation of potential game maps.
- `Tarefa2_2021li1g006`: Construction and deconstruction of game maps.
- `Tarefa3_2021li1g006`: Textual representation of the game.
- `Tarefa4_2021li1g006`: Character movement within the game.
- `Tarefa5_2021li1g006`: Complete graphical application using the Gloss library.
- `Tarefa6_2021li1g006`: Automated puzzle-solving algorithm.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) installed. You can find instructions for installing GHC [here](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/).

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

3. Compile the main program

5. Run the compiled executable:

## Game Play

- Use keyboard arrows or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys for character movement.
- Climb over obstacles and navigate through the map to reach the exit.
- Solve the puzzles in the minimum number of moves.
